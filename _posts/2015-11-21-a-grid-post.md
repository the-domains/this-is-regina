TheGrid has Arrived... Now what?

Well, after waiting over a year, I finally got access to my "TheGrid" account.

What's TheGrid? Well, it's touted to be the next thing in website design. An AI that takes words and images and other content and makes something wonderful out of them even if, like me, you couldn't tell good design from dog food.

So, around September or October of last year, I became a founding member and threw in my cash to further the effort along.

Today I got the announcement that my account was ready, albeit in beta, for me to start using and breaking and commenting on.

Here I am using it and, at this point, I'm not quite getting it.

I was kinda expecting something, well, different. I had visions of words and images mystically and magically melding themselves into something that I couldn't build on my own with my anti-design abilities.

Instead, what I get is the feeling that I'm working on WordPress, without the options or control.

Like I said, I don't quite get it.

But, I'll keep you posted...
