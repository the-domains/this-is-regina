# Home of DevFacto Regina

Have pity on us. We are the poor souls, employees of DevFacto Regina, who must work above two of the best places to eat and drink in Regina.

I know, what a life, but believe me, when it's the middle of summer, on a Friday afternoon, and you're struggling with a freaky little coding problem, the knowledge that just a few feet below you people are soakin' up the sun and enjoying something frosty is enough to make you... well, I'm sure you get the idea.

OK, boys, crank up the Wi-Fi. It's off to the downstairs boardroom for us!
